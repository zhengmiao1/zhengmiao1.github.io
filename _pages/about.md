# About Me
I am a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in the **application of Computer vision, Signal Processing, and Artificial Intelligence technologies** within the domains of **Agriculture** and **Aquaculture**.

I earned my master's degree in Agricultural Electricity and Automation from China Agricultural University, under the guidance of **Prof. Daoliang Li**. My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Mechanism and Automation from Shanxi Agriculture University.

My research interests revolve around the realms of artificial intelligence, signal processing, and computer vision. These areas have been the focal points of my academic and professional pursuits.

**I‚Äôm open to collaborating on interdisciplinary research and projects. Feel free to drop me an email.**
